         * I've been programming for many years, 9-10 years at the time of writing this.
         * However, I feel that I've always been lacking in 3 departments:
         *
         * - Separation of Concerns
         * - DataStructures & Algorithms (& Big O notation)
         * - Technical Terminology
         *
         * The purpose of this project in particular is to show my progression and understanding,
         * to prove that I understand the problem and its aspects,
         * and to work on breaking down major problems into smaller solvable ones.
