# Capabilities
Experimental project to work on improving my Data Structures and Algorithms to better understand efficiency,
and language functionality.

## Post Project Comments
After completing the tutorial, I must say that while there was a lot I was already familiar with, 
there was also a lot that I learned. 

I was surprised at how simple/basic a lot of the data structures were,
such as Hashmaps for example. Yet they're one of the most efficient data structures we can use today. 

And on the other hand, sorting algorithms are seemingly extremely complicated and relatively inefficient. 
It makes sense in hindsight since we would need to do a read operation on every element, 
but having the ability to break out your operations into parallel capable operations is huge for efficiency.

With that being said, 
I find that a lot of the more complicated algorithms are usually defined by the little checks that they do, 
or how they're structured so that they can be broken up or recursed on. In these terms, I have a lot to practice. 

## My Next Steps

I felt pretty confident in my abilities up until we got more into graphs, sorting, and binary trees. 
I think the tutorial I followed was purposely oversimplifying it so that they could get the point across easier
and more efficiently. However, I found my mind wondering throughout it all trying to figure out the other possibilities,
which I believe distracted me from learning, and effectively understanding the topic.

At some point, I'll be reviewing these topics to better grasp the concepts I missed.

## My Favorites

Off the bat, I was always afraid of big O notation, 
but I feel like I have a much better understanding of the concept now.

Additionally, I have worked with Graphs in the past, but never fully understood it. 
I'm really glad I was able to dive in-depth in these concepts.

## My Proudest Moments

I'm especially proud that I took the time to try and do the work myself before watching the tutorial. 
I think I learned a lot more by understanding the concept and applying it myself, 
before watching someone else go through it.

One of the things I was really proud about, was my ability to take some of the concepts like recursion, 
and apply my own solutions instead of the ones from the tutorial. 
I've worked a lot in programming, and I'm glad I got to show some of it off.

I'm also glad I was able to take the concepts and apply most of them to Generic values instead of hard-coded values.
